# What is it?
This is the low-order a-coefficients from the SoHo/HMI data during 2020
The txt file finishing by m6, contains the first 6 a-coefficients
The txt file finishing by m18, contains the first 18 a-coefficients

To make the plots of the a1,a2,a3, the m6 file is enough

The IDL procedures in process_hmidata.pro are to plot for a1,a2,a3.
