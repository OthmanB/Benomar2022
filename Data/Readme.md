# What is here?

	- External_data: Any data which was taken from an external source. Those data are provided here.
	- Figures_publish: All of the figures obtained by the programs given in [root]/Programs and that are in the published paper. Those data are NOT provided in Github.
	- Extra_data: Additional and figures which are not in the paper. This is early tests and visualisations. Those data are provided here.
	- MCMC_Spectrum_data: inputs / outputs / products of the Power Spectrum analysis for the Sun and 16 Cyg A/B. Those data are NOT provided in Github.
	- MCMC_Activity_data: inputs / outputs / products of the a-coefficient analysis for the Sun and 16 Cyb A/B. Those data are NOT provided Github.
	- MCMC_Simulation_data: inputs / outputs/ products of the Poster Spectrum analysis on simulated stars. Those data are NOT provided Github.
	- grids: grids of Alm that are used to make some of the plots. Those data are provided here.

I made available most of the data on a IPFS-based (https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) database (https://filebase.com).
Be aware that the Simulation data are very large (70 Gb). They have been sliced into 10 Gb segments. 

Here are the links to compressed version of the data:
