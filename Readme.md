### Suite of tools associated to the Benomar+2022 Publication ###

The directory 'Program' contains all of the programs that were used to perform analysis. These are essentially 'cleaned' version of the codes that were used and structured in a way that they are easy to use.
The Data directory contains data used as inputs / outputs / products of the analyses performed here. Many of those data being too large, they are not available in the Github account directly. 
However, I made available most of the data on a IPFS-based (https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) database (https://filebase.com).
Be aware that the Simulation data are very large (70 Gb). 

Here are the links to compressed version of the data:
