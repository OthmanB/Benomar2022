### Suite of tools associated to the Benomar+2022 Publication ###

The directory 'Program' contains all of the programs that were used to perform analysis. These are essentially 'cleaned' version of the codes that were used and structured in a way that they are easy to use.
The Data directory contains data used as inputs / outputs / products of the analyses performed here. Many of those data being too large, they are not available in the Github account directly. Instead they need to be requested. I might add them in a permanent repository such as IPFS storage later on.
